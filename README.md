# RecSearch

A web application that I am currently working on, it allows users to search recipes online.
<br> Project from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/).

### Built with:
* This project mainly focuses on practicing with JavaScript ES6; using async functions,
arrow notation, try/catch and more. 
* [food2fork](https://www.food2fork.com/about/api) - Data retrieved from API.
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - NPM is a package manager for Node.js. It makes it easy 
to specify the project's dependencies inside a .json file and the versions used in the project.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Webpack is a module bundler. Webpack can take a large amount
of assets and transform them into one big file. In this case it is used only for JavaScript.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Because this project was used to 
practice ES6, babel was used to compile to other JavaScript versions such as ES5 aswell.
